[Source]  =  test.c

Preprocess  =>  gcc -E test.c > test.i

[Modified Source]  =   test.i

Compile   =>   gcc -S -masm=intel test.i

[Assembly]   =   test.s

Assembler  =>   as -o test.o test.s

[Object Code]  =   test.o

Linker    =>    objdump -M intel -d test.o > test.dump

[Exe File]  =   test.exe    =     objdump -M intel -d test.o > test.exe

[Loader + Execution] =>  ./a.out   // for linux


// Run a simple c code first in shortcut way then following all the steps above

For shortcut 

gcc -o test.o test.c
objdump -M intel -d test.o > test.dump

Then the dump file got from the step by step execution will be shorter than the short cut method
